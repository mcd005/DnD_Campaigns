# MCDs DM Philosophy

*Note I have not DMed before and these may be subject to change*

- Creativity from players is rewarded above all
	- We want to be generating memorable moments every session
		- Characters like Gianni 
		- Richard Longwood arm wrestling a huge barmaid then stripping to earn our lodgings
		- Grigor turing into a snake-rope to rescue Karth
		- Seal Team 6
		- Ivanna basically being a Connery-era Bond girl 
	- The implications of this
		- Things like *Minor Illusion* can be powerful
				- Conjuration magic exists in the world so if a goblin sees a bear trap appear in front of it, it won't necessarily know if it's real
- The story should constantly be moving
	- There needs to be urgency
	- I **will** be proactive in moving things along
- We want lots more spontaneous medium-stakes situations that aren't just combat
- Power gaming is encouraged
	- Multi-class away!
		- Ideally would like RP reasons behind it though
- I never want a player to feel like they can't have any impact in combat
	- During character creation I will try and offer suggestions so your character will always have some option during a battle
- Playing a martial characters should be as interesting as playing a caster
	- I will use the special attacks introduced in BG3 (e.g. piercing shot etc)
	- I will introduce the power attacks house rule
- As a DM I will try to give players a way of finding out weaknesses of a creature
	- They will need to do some research or pick up clues from the environment
- I'm pretty relaxed about rules lawyering
	- I of course will stick by Rule 0 but:
		- Virtually every rule in this book has been covered discussed somewhere on the internet so there lots of "case law"
		- Jeremy Crawford is the high judge so if you show me something he's tweeted I will typically take it as law
