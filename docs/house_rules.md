# MCDs DnD House Rules

1. No *Shield* spell.
2. A levelled spell gained through a class may only be cast with armor or shield equipped if that class provides the proficiency for that armor or shield.
3. You can switch from a one handed weapon to another using your bonus action.
    e.g. from dagger to hand crossbow
4. When you use the **attack action** to make an attack using a weapon or unarmed strike, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to that attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the damage roll with a heavy weapon and +5 for a one handed weapon and +4 for a finesse weapon.
	1. e.g. for war pick which is 1d8 you get +5
	1. Only for PCs
	1. Cantrips and bonus action deliberately excluded
5. Martial character can do the special attacks from BG3
6. Flanking is now a +2 bonus to hit when you outnumber the enemy at least 2-to-1 and a +5 for 3-to-1
7. [Variant Encumbrance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#VariantEncumbrance)
8. You can Thunderstep with characters up to size medium, regardless of your characters size.
9. *This is RAW but potions are an action*
10. Peace and Twilight Cleric Domains are banned

## Rationale

For 1 and 2: Casters are the most "powerful" classes in the game. When you multiclass then they also become the most armoured in the game. This is kind of broken.

For 3-5: Martial characters need more scope and more choice.
